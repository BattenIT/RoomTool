# Development Session Summary - September 30, 2025

## Session Overview
Continued development session from previous work. Implemented text-only view toggle, print functionality, availability filtering, UI refinements, and styling improvements.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Text-Only Toggle Mode
**Commit:** `b9fa2a6` - Add text-only toggle mode for simplified room view

**Changes:**
- Added toggle switch in controls section for text-only mode
- Implemented `renderTextOnlyView()` method to generate clean text list
- Shows room name, status badge, and event times/titles only
- Maintains room sorting (available rooms first)
- Toggle switches between card view and text-only view
- Styled text-only view with clean typography and spacing

**Files Modified:**
- `index.html` - Added toggle HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functionality

---

### 2. Enhanced Text-Only View for Week/Month
**Commit:** `e205315` - Add print functionality and enhance text-only view

**Changes:**
- Week view shows dates grouped by day within each room (e.g., "Monday, 9/30/2025")
- Month view shows dates grouped by day within each room (e.g., "Mon, Sep 30")
- Split `renderTextOnlyView()` into three methods:
  - `renderTextOnlyDay()` - Day view with current status
  - `renderTextOnlyWeek()` - Week view with date headers
  - `renderTextOnlyMonth()` - Month view with date headers
- Each room displays events organized by date within the view period

---

### 3. Print Functionality
**Commit:** `e205315` - Add print functionality and enhance text-only view

**Changes:**
- Added print button to controls with printer icon
- Implemented `printSchedule()` method with view-specific titles:
  - Day: "Room Schedules - [Full Date]"
  - Week: "Room Schedules - Week of [Start Date] to [End Date]"
  - Month: "Room Schedules - [Month Year]"
- Added print media queries to hide controls and optimize layout
- Room cards/sections avoid page breaks for cleaner printing

**CSS Changes:**
```css
@media print {
    .controls-section,
    .find-rooms-fab,
    .print-btn {
        display: none !important;
    }
    .room-card, .text-only-room {
        break-inside: avoid;
        page-break-inside: avoid;
    }
}
```

---

### 4. Simplified Status Badges
**Commit:** `1715a8b` - Simplify room status badges to In Use or Available

**Changes:**
- Removed confusing "Partial" status
- Now shows only two statuses:
  - **"In Use"** = Room is occupied right now (red badge)
  - **"Available"** = Room is free right now, even if events scheduled later (green badge)
- Applied to both card view and text-only view

**Reasoning:** Users were confused by "Partial" - they wanted to know if the room was available NOW, not whether it had events later in the day.

---

### 5. Removed Hover Animations
**Commit:** `3f86b01` - Remove hover animations from room cards

**Changes:**
- Removed `translateY` and `scale` animations on card hover
- Removed week view row hover effects
- Cleaner, less distracting interface

**User Feedback:** "not sure i like the animations when you hover over the cards, lets just remove them for now"

---

### 6. Availability Filter
**Commit:** `e1dd711` - Add availability filter and calendar refresh info banner

**Changes:**
- Added "Available Only" toggle switch in controls
- When enabled, only shows rooms that are free right now (not in use)
- Works in both card view and text-only view
- Filter applied in both `renderDayView()` and `renderTextOnlyView()`

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Apply availability filter if enabled
if (this.availabilityFilter && this.availabilityFilter.checked) {
    const now = new Date();
    const targetDate = this.currentDate.toDateString();
    roomsToShow = roomsToShow.filter(room => {
        return !this.isRoomBusyAtTime(room, now, targetDate);
    });
}
```

---

### 7. Calendar Refresh Info Banner
**Commit:** `e1dd711` - Add availability filter and calendar refresh info banner

**Changes:**
- Added blue info banner at top of page
- Explains that calendars refresh every 15 minutes
- Informs users to allow up to 15 minutes for new Outlook bookings to appear

**Technical Details:**
- Azure Function `CalendarRefresh` runs on cron schedule: `0 */15 * * * *` (every 15 minutes)
- Function is defined in `azure-function/CalendarRefresh/function.json`
- Fetches 8 calendar URLs from Outlook and caches in Azure Blob Storage

**Banner Text:**
> "Calendar updates every 15 minutes. After booking a room in Outlook, allow up to 15 minutes for it to appear on this dashboard."

---

### 8. Font Size Reductions
**Commits:**
- `36efb2a` - Reduce room name font size for better fit
- `20877d9` - Reduce room name font size to 1rem for better fit

**Changes:**
- First reduction: Changed room name font from 1.375rem to 1.125rem
- Second reduction: Changed room name font from 1.125rem to 1rem
- Mobile view reduced from 1.125rem to 1rem

**Reasoning:** Ensures long names like "Pavilion X Basement Room 1" fit on one line without wrapping

---

### 9. Bold Sans-Serif Font for Room Names
**Commit:** `0416977` - Change room names to bold sans-serif font

**Changes:**
- Changed from Crimson Text (serif) to system sans-serif stack
- Uses Arial Black with fallbacks for bold, modern look
- Increased font-weight to 900 for extra boldness
- Adjusted letter-spacing to -0.02em for better readability

**Font Stack:**
```css
font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Arial Black',
             'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
```

---

### 10. Remove Expand/Collapse Buttons
**Commit:** `c510c99` - Remove expand/collapse buttons to fix toolbar scrolling

**Changes:**
- Removed expand/collapse buttons from controls toolbar
- Cards are always expanded now (no collapse functionality needed)
- Fixes horizontal scrolling issue in controls section
- Removed associated CSS and JavaScript functions:
  - `collapseAllRooms()`
  - `expandAllRooms()`
  - `.collapse-btn` CSS styles

**User Feedback:** "the expand/collapse/refresh toolbar has a scroll wheel on it. id rather not scroll to use these tools"

---

### 11. Styled Date Display
**Commit:** `f0e683c` - Style date display with bold orange Arial Black font

**Changes:**
- Changed date font to Arial Black (weight 900) to match room names
- Changed color to UVA orange (#e57200) for bright, prominent display
- Increased font size to 1.125rem
- Removed max-width constraint from `.nav-compact` to left-align with header logos
- Date now left-aligns with Frank Batten School logo

**CSS:**
```css
.current-date-display {
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Arial Black',
                 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
    font-weight: 900;
    font-size: 1.125rem;
    color: var(--uva-orange);

}
```

- Clean interface without animations
- Simple "Available" or "In Use" status
- Toolbar fits without scrolling

## Key Learnings

### Calendar Refresh Timing
- Azure Function refreshes every 15 minutes (`0 */15 * * * *`)
- Frontend auto-refreshes from blob storage every 30 seconds
- Total delay: Up to 15 minutes for new bookings to appear

### Room Status Logic
```javascript
isRoomBusyAtTime(room, targetTime, targetDate) {
    const event = this.events.find(event => {
        const roomMatch = event.room === room;
        const dateMatch = event.startTime.toDateString() === targetDate;
        const timeMatch = event.startTime <= targetTime && event.endTime > targetTime;
        return roomMatch && dateMatch && timeMatch;
    });
    return !!event;
}
```

### Sorting Algorithm
Rooms are sorted with available rooms first, then alphabetically:
```javascript
roomsToShow.sort((a, b) => {
    const aAvailable = !this.isRoomBusyAtTime(a, now, targetDate);
    const bAvailable = !this.isRoomBusyAtTime(b, now, targetDate);

    if (aAvailable && !bAvailable) return -1;
    if (!aAvailable && bAvailable) return 1;

    return a.localeCompare(b);
});
```
