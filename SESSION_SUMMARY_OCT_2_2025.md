## Features Implemented

### 1. Smart Date Pre-filling for Room Bookings
**Commits:** `b21716f`, `32f8a37`, `c132d39`

**Problem Solved:**
Users reported that when viewing future availability and clicking "Reserve a Room", Outlook would open with today's date instead of the date they were viewing. This created a frustrating workflow where users had to manually change dates and couldn't see room availability while booking.

**Changes:**
- Reserve Room button now pre-fills Outlook with the **date being viewed** (not today's date)
- Smart time selection logic:
  - **Viewing today before 5 PM:** Rounds up to next half-hour (e.g., 2:15 PM → 2:30 PM, 2:45 PM → 3:00 PM)
  - **Viewing future dates:** Defaults to 9:00 AM
  - **After 5 PM:** Defaults to 9:00 AM next day
- Default 1-hour meeting duration
- Uses ISO 8601 format for Outlook Web Access compatibility
- Fixed URL format to use modern Outlook deep link: `outlook.office.com/calendar/deeplink/compose`
- Properly encodes all URL parameters using URLSearchParams API

**User Workflow Now:**
1. Browse to future date (e.g., October 10th) ✓
2. See which rooms are available ✓
3. Click "Reserve Room" → Outlook opens with October 10th @ 9:00 AM ✓
4. Adjust time as needed while seeing availability ✓

**Technical Details:**
```javascript
// Round to nearest half-hour
if (currentMinutes === 0) {
    bookingDate.setHours(currentHours, 30, 0, 0);  // 2:00 → 2:30
} else if (currentMinutes <= 30) {
    bookingDate.setHours(currentHours, 30, 0, 0);  // 2:15 → 2:30
} else {
    bookingDate.setHours(currentHours + 1, 0, 0, 0);  // 2:45 → 3:00
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `index.html` - Updated booking URL generation logic

---

### 2. Booking Conflict Warning System
**Commit:** `5a883c2`

**Problem Solved:**
Users could accidentally try to book rooms during times when they're already reserved, creating potential double-booking conflicts.

**Changes:**
- Added smart conflict detection when clicking "Reserve Room"
- Shows warning dialog if room is already booked during selected time
- Lists all conflicting events with times and titles
- Allows user to proceed if they want to coordinate with current booking holder
- No warning if room is available - proceeds directly to Outlook

**User Experience:**
```
⚠️ BOOKING CONFLICT WARNING

This room is already reserved during your selected time:

  • 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM: Team Meeting
  • 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM: Client Call

You may need to coordinate with the current booking holder.

Do you want to proceed with booking anyway?
[OK] [Cancel]
```

**Conflict Detection Logic:**
- Checks if default booking time overlaps with ANY existing events
- Detects partial overlaps, full overlaps, and spanning bookings
- Shows all conflicting events in one dialog

**Files Modified:**
- `index.html` - Added conflict detection and confirmation dialog

### 3. Mac Display Overflow Fixes
**Commit:** `b48dbbf`, `e079956`

**Problem Solved:**
Mac users (especially on 16" displays) reported two overflow issues:
1. Date picker calendar dropdown was getting clipped at the top
2. Event details modal had horizontal overflow with long text (URLs, meeting IDs)
3. Controls toolbar was too wide, causing horizontal scrolling

**Changes:**

**Date Picker Fix:**
- Added `overflow-y: visible` to controls section
- Prevents native date picker dropdown from being cut off

**Event Modal Fix:**
- Added `overflow-x: hidden` to prevent horizontal scroll
- Added `word-wrap: break-word` and `overflow-wrap: break-word` for text wrapping
- Added `white-space: pre-wrap` to description text (preserves line breaks while wrapping)
- Applied word wrapping to all text elements (title, room, location, description, organizer)

**Controls Toolbar Fix:**
- Changed `flex-wrap` from `nowrap` to `wrap` (allows controls to wrap to second row)
- Changed `overflow-x` from `auto` to `visible` (no horizontal scrollbar)
- Added `max-width: 1400px` to container (prevents excessive width on large displays)
- Keeps `width: 95%` for responsive sizing

**Result:**
- Date picker displays fully without clipping
- Long text/URLs wrap properly in modals
- Controls wrap to multiple rows if needed instead of causing horizontal scroll
- Works on all Mac display sizes and browser widths

**Files Modified:**
- `index.html` - Updated CSS for overflow handling and text wrapping

### 4. Comprehensive AV Equipment Information
**Commit:** `af580ef`

**Problem Solved:**
Users needed to know what AV equipment is available in each room before booking to ensure the space meets their technical needs.

**Changes:**
- Added detailed AV equipment specifications for all 8 rooms
- Implemented side-by-side dropdown buttons for better UX
- Two separate buttons: "Room Capacity" and "AV Equipment"
- Each button expands/collapses independently
- Only shows buttons if room has that information type

## User Feedback Addressed

### Issue 1: Future Date Booking

**Resolution:** ✅ Fixed - Reserve button now pre-fills with viewed date and smart time

### Issue 2: Mac Display Width
**User Feedback:**
> "On his mac the top bars still are way too wide like the screen shots i gave you earlier"

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Why Side-by-Side Dropdowns?
**Options Considered:**
1. Combined dropdown (original)
2. Side-by-side buttons (chosen)
3. Stacked buttons
4. Tabbed interface

**Decision Rationale:**
- Side-by-side provides clear visual separation
- Users can choose what info they need
- Clean layout without taking too much vertical space
- Each section can be expanded independently

### Why Emojis for AV Info?
- Quick visual scanning
- Makes technical info more approachable
- Reduces text density
- Cross-browser/platform compatible
- User-friendly for non-technical staff

### Why Half-Hour Rounding?
- Matches typical meeting scheduling patterns
- More granular than hourly rounding
- Reduces manual time adjustment in Outlook
- Aligns with how people actually book meetings

---

## Known Limitations & Future Considerations

### Current Limitations
1. AV equipment info is static (not dynamically updated)
2. No way to request mobile equipment through the dashboard
3. Conflict warnings don't prevent actual double-bookings
4. No room photos or floor plans

### Potential Future Enhancements
1. **Equipment Request System:**
   - Button to request mobile AV equipment
   - Integration with facilities management system
   - Automated email notifications

2. **Visual Room Information:**
   - Room photos/360° views
   - Floor plan integration
   - Seating arrangement diagrams

3. **Advanced Booking Features:**
   - Book directly from dashboard (not just Outlook link)
   - Recurring booking support
   - Equipment bundling (e.g., "TV + microphones")

4. **Analytics & Reporting:**
   - Most requested equipment
   - Room utilization by AV setup type
   - Popular booking times

5. **User Preferences:**
   - Save favorite rooms
   - Default booking duration settings
   - Notification preferences
